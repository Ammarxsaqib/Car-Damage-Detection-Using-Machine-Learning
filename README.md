Introduction
This report details the development of an application designed to detect car damage and assess 
its intensity from an image. The project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for 
damage detection and the VGG16 architecture for classifying the damage intensity. Additionally, 
Firebase is used for user authentication, and Python is utilized for backend model training.
Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are:
• To develop a machine learning model capable of detecting car damage from an image.
• To classify the detected damage into categories of intensity (minor or severe).
• To integrate these models into a user-friendly mobile application using Kotlin.
• To ensure secure user authentication using Firebase.
System Architecture
The system architecture comprises the following components:
1. Frontend: User interface for uploading car images and viewing results.
2. Backend: Handles image processing, model inference, and communication with 
Firebase.
3. Machine Learning Models:
o CNN model for detecting whether the car is damaged.
o VGG16 model for determining the intensity of the damage.
4. Firebase: Manages user authentication (login and signup).

Technology Stack
The technologies and tools used in this project include:
• Frontend: Kotlin
• Backend: Python (Flask)
• Machine Learning:
o TensorFlow/Keras (for model training and inference)
o OpenCV (for image processing)
• Authentication: Firebase Authentication
Model Description
Car Damage Detection
Model Architecture
The car damage detection model is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed to classify 
images into two categories: damaged or not damaged.
Training
• Dataset: A diverse dataset of car images with labeled damage annotations.
• Preprocessing: Resizing images, normalization, and data augmentation.
• Training Process: The model was trained using a supervised learning approach, 
optimizing for accuracy and minimizing loss using techniques like early stopping and 
dropout to prevent overfitting.
Damage Intensity Classification
Model Architecture
The VGG16 model, pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, is fine-tuned to classify the intensity of 
the damage into minor or severe categories.
Training
• Dataset: Subset of the car damage dataset, annotated with intensity labels.
• Preprocessing: Similar preprocessing steps as the detection model.
• Fine-tuning: The pre-trained VGG16 model was fine-tuned with additional dense layers 
to adapt to the new classification task.

Integration and Deployment
Backend Integration
The backend, developed in Python, integrates both models for seamless inference. When a user 
uploads an image:
1. The image is preprocessed and passed to the CNN model for damage detection.
2. If damage is detected, the image is further processed by the VGG16 model to classify the 
damage intensity.
Mobile App Integration
The mobile app allows users to upload images and view results. It communicates with the 
backend via REST APIs to send images and receive predictions.
Deployment
The backend is deployed on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud) to ensure scalability 
and reliability. Continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines are set up for smooth 
updates and maintenance.
Firebase Authentication
Firebase Authentication is implemented to manage user login and signup processes securely. It 
supports various authentication methods such as email/password, Google, and Facebook sign-in.
Features
• Signup: Users can create an account using their email or social media accounts.
• Login: Registered users can log in to the app securely.
• Authentication Tokens: Secure tokens are used to verify user sessions and manage 
access.
User Interface
The user interface is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly. Key features include:
• Image Upload: Users can upload car images from their device.
• Result Display: Clear display of damage detection results and intensity classification.
• User Profile: Allows users to manage their account and view their uploaded images and 
results.

Challenges and Solutions
Data Challenges
• Challenge: Limited availability of labeled datasets for car damage and intensity.
• Solution: Data augmentation techniques and synthetic data generation were used to 
enhance the dataset.
Model Performance
• Challenge: Balancing model accuracy and inference speed.
• Solution: Optimized model architecture and used transfer learning to improve 
performance.
Integration
• Challenge: Ensuring seamless integration between frontend, backend, and Firebase.
• Solution: Thorough testing and use of robust API design practices.
Conclusion
The car damage detection and intensity analysis application successfully combine machine 
learning models with a user-friendly mobile interface and secure authentication. This project 
demonstrates the effective use of CNN and VGG16 models for real-world applications, 
providing valuable insights and functionality for users.
Future Work
Future enhancements could include:
• Expanding the Dataset: Continuously adding more labeled images to improve model 
accuracy.
• Real-Time Analysis: Implementing real-time damage detection using video streams.
• Multi-class Classification: Extending the damage intensity classification to include more 
categories.
• User Feedback Loop: Incorporating user feedback to refine model predictions over time.
